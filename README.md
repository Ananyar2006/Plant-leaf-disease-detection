# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection using ML, DL, QML, and QNN

This full-stack web application detects whether a plant leaf is healthy or diseased based on an uploaded image. It integrates **Machine Learning (Random Forest)**, **Deep Learning (CNN)**, **Quantum Machine Learning (VQC)**, and **Quantum Neural Networks (EstimatorQNN)**. The frontend is built with **Streamlit**, backend with **Python**, and **MySQL** is used for data storage. DevOps tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** automate testing and deployment. The project follows the **Agile Scrum** methodology.

## Key Features

- User Login & Registration (MySQL)
- Upload leaf images via Streamlit interface
- Predicts disease using:
  - **ML** (Random Forest)
  - **DL** (CNN with Keras)
  - **QML** (VQC via Qiskit)
  - **QNN** (EstimatorQNN via PyTorch + Qiskit)
- Final prediction by **majority voting**
- Stores predictions in MySQL database
- Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions
- Dockerized app, deployed with Kubernetes

## Models Used

- **Random Forest**: Trained on 512-length color histogram features
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Trained on 128Ã—128 leaf images using Keras
- **QML (Quantum Machine Learning)**: Uses `ZZFeatureMap` + `VQC` from Qiskit
- **QNN (Quantum Neural Network)**: Hybrid model using `EstimatorQNN` and PyTorch
